# CDK multi config. TypeScript project

## Steps to deploy this CDK project

This project uses âœ¨ magic of git-branch and npm scripts ðŸª„

- After git clone, run npm install to install dependencies
- The project uses git branches to manage environments
- It needs a unique .env file per git branch - (ex: .env.<branch-name>)
- Currently there are two branches - main and develop
- Duplicate the .env.example file as .env.main and .env.develop
- Modify the `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` and `DEFAULT_REGION` values

## Usage

So every time you have different branches, you can add a corresponding aws sandbox or prod account

- If you want to deploy to your `dev` aws account, you only have to
- Populate the relevant values in `.env.develop`

```sh
git checkout develop && npm run deploy
```

- If you want to deploy to your `prod` aws account, you only have to
- Populate the relevant values in `.env.main`

```sh
git checkout main && npm run deploy
```

## Example contents inside an .env.develop file

```
BRANCH=develop
ENVIRONMENT=dev

AWS_PROFILE = "burner"
DEFAULT_REGION = "ap-southeast-2"
DEFAULT_ACCOUNT = 123456789101
```
